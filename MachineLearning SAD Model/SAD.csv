suicide,What is the most successful medicine?
suicide,Can paracetamol kill you..? I think this is the easiest way as I got to hide from everyone by faking that I have a fever...
suicide,It is the easiest one and is the most best one to do because you can buy pills from the shop and they don't question you!
suicide,What is the fastest way to commit suicide?
suicide,Might try mom has lots of medicines. -11 year old
suicide,Would beta blockers work? If so how many would I need to take?
suicide,I wouldn't recommend overdosing
suicide,I've tried this so many times. All it did was make me feel numb
suicide,I feel like I'm useless to everyone
suicide,I only live with my dad and his girlfriend but he never talks to me anymore. I feel like I can't do this anymore...
suicide,Done it before almost worked till my brother came home. So this is better is painless
suicide,"Gonna try this in a few months, maybe?"
suicide,"It would be quick and easy, just falling asleep...forever haha"
suicide,Hi: I am a 67 year old male. 'triple bypass survivor... because of all of the drugs I have to take to keep me alive.
suicide,The drugs do keep me alive... but...because I am not the father and husband I should be and used to be. I want to end my life...
suicide,"so 'please respond with the ""any suggestions"" How I can... end my life without any pain or memory."
suicide,This is what I'm doing now sick of life hate it just want to go 
suicide,It would be just like going to sleep
suicide,"Just die, stop breathing, you can stop it all with various ways. You can stop it."
suicide,"I would do it this way every time. Apart from the spending money to buy, say, heroin, u can easily fall asleep and never wake up, know more than one who have gone out this way. Just make sure u use enough."
suicide,It works and its easy to do my mom has A LOT of drugs and one time she said some of them could kill me sooo to be honest I'm most likely going to do this one
suicide,This would be pretty easy for me as I have access to controlled drugs
suicide,Easiest and u don't feel anything just drink the pills and fall to the ground all u do is swallow something nothing else
suicide,I have considered suicide in the past
suicide,Was here to end it all and ended up laughing at all these comments you guys are great love you all
suicide,"Yeah, my dad did this, I suffer from depression so I might try too"
suicide,You just need to buy about a dozen fever pills and done.
suicide,It's disturbing how many people on this list want to die...
suicide,I need to know what pills to take to commit suicide
suicide,I tried about 10 years ago unfortunately my friend found me in time. I was in a hospital for almost a month now I'm ready to try again I can't take the pain n heart ache my son is causing me
suicide,"Well, I don't want to feel such a great pain when I wanted to die. So, I'm going to use this option right now."
suicide,"I've done it, of course didn't die, I didn't feel a thing."
suicide,Worked good popped a couple and I died worked like a charm
suicide,It is the least painful and the easiest way to commit suicide. Might try it.
suicide,The fact that this list is trending scares me
suicide,I was searching on how to kill myself but yeah okay
suicide,"Kids don't do it, you will only feel numb."
suicide,Sounds fun I tried but just had a seizure my mom found me and I went to a phych ward
suicide,"A girl at school did this. At one point I was suicidal and seriously considered it. Yet, I feel I may be going back to that place. Probably why I'm here."
suicide,Sometimes I want die but I think it is important to live that I have mission in this world and suicide not the right option to end your problem.
suicide,I've tried it but unluckily didn't die.
suicide,I think this is the best way cause then u can just sleep and then your dead
suicide,I believe sleeping pills are the most efficient although they sometimes do not work and just get you sick.
suicide,Least painful and easy. Nobody will know if you do it. Does atomoxitine kill you?
suicide,"I tried overdosing on Tylenol. Man, the pain though."
suicide,What other pills can I take?
suicide,"If you take a bunch of sleeping pills like Xanax or something it will knock you out, you'll die in your sleep. Painless, Plus you get to do your favorite thing before death. SLEEP."
suicide,Anyone who has a solid suggestion of what pills and where I could find them
suicide,I am 15 I have tried to kill myself 3 times and I got saved or it didn't work each time so do u think this will actually work?
suicide,I know some pills will just make your organs fail and not kill you. Any recommendations as to which pills to take?
suicide,I tried this 7 times already each time I took 100% more pills and it never worked. I tried mixing the pills too
suicide,"I just need to get some money and then buy some pills, then ill take at least 20 and then I can finally die"
suicide,"It is much less painful to overdose on pills, then jump off a height or stab yourself to be honest"
suicide,I think this one is best. Since you could just die and you won't noitce at all! So I could just fall to sleep like how Aoura in the sleeping beuty did.
suicide,The heart disease pills
suicide,And the blood sugar pills
suicide,Trust me they work
suicide,"I tried this but did not manage to have enough before my guardian came home, planning on trying it again sometime"
suicide,Which pills do I use? How many do I use? Can I do this at school?
suicide,It is simple and painless. All that happens is you fall asleep and never wake up
suicide,I recommend using Prozac for an overdose.
suicide,Very good way tried it once didn't work
suicide,I thank it would help and I'm bipolar+4
suicide,Which pills are the best to choose?
suicide,Ima try this with sleeping pills
suicide,I think this is less painful so 4 thumbs up for this
suicide,It's a great way To go if no one knows what you took
suicide,This is the best in my opinion but it depends on your body becos some just vomit when overdosing
suicide,"Climb a mountain, bottle of booze a bottle of pills... Yeah the best way"
suicide,"I have had suicidal thoughts in the past and I was thinking to do this... but regardless, remember you are always loved"
suicide,I would rather die this way then shooting yourself because that would be more painful.
suicide,Worked very well with sleeping pills and alcohol!
suicide,I guess a lot of people want to commit suicide according to the likes

suicide,This is meant to be agony but I am honestly thinking of trying it
suicide,I'm thinking bout doing it to myself
suicide,Look around everybody's doing it
suicide,All those suicidal comments here are just shocking
suicide,Thanks imma try this later today after I go to work
suicide,Not a bad idea but depending on what u wanna go out on could be expensive
suicide,Tried it but I only got a fever. Maybe I should try the strong medicine
suicide,"Great, I want to die, and commit suicide!"
suicide,Thank you for showing me this.
suicide,I hope I can actually go to sleep after this
suicide,I did it ones it worked like it should.
suicide,"I'm gonna test it tonight, so its probably gonna be effective"
suicide,"I'll take 37 pills, I'm 11 years old so I hope these pills are enough."
suicide,It works if u take the right stuff
suicide,"Easy, cause it works with many kinds of pills"
suicide,"Pentobarbital might be just about the most effective and ""peaceful"" method of commiting suicide, but its inaccessibility (Schedule II in the USA) makes it tough to obtain."
suicide,You want your loved ones to find you this way? drugs in your system? Hanging at least get across that is wasn't an accident and not a scream for help gone wrong.
suicide,I going to try and take a whole bottle of sleeping pills and some NyQuil pills
suicide,"Don't do this, I survived and it was extremely painful. At least don't use Tylenol, I used 2x the lethal dose but it still didn't work."
suicide,"Overdose of anything works, I tried out with wine and detergent, almost worked but threw up blood after 6 hours of sleeping. do make sure to take smth or some sort of pills that can stop u from throwing up just in case"
suicide,I really love fentanyl and my bro killed himself next to me just now. This is so epic and I can't wait to follow his steps! Good luck!
suicide,"I took a half bottle of 30 mg morphine tablets and still survived, although I was in a coma for a week."
suicide,I would love to do this! I even have Benadryl no one cares any damn way...!
suicide,"I still need to do the research but I'm guessing fentenal would be easily obtained, not very painful and would have a fairly high probability of success.just my opinion and guesswork so far though."
suicide,"I did this once, almost worked but for some reason I still walked to work anyways and my co worker called an ambulance. Fml."
suicide,I'm gonna do that and hopefully it wokrs because I'm done withthe pain..
suicide,I want to do but I life in afrika so mo medecone only fpr aids and ebola can I'm do it with those
suicide,"This is my way...a person can only take so much before they’re pushed over there limit...my limit has already been passed, I honestly think this is it"
suicide,Make sure you take the correct pills because if they’re not strong enough or if you don’t take enough then it will not work all you will do is feel dizzy or tired so make sure you take strong ones and a lot of them : )
suicide,"I tried to find signals but nobody saw them, I'm sorry to whomever I may hurt"
suicide,"I couldn’t ever hang myself but the pill overdose is seeming like the way to go, in my sleep peacefully"
suicide,I am considering suicide but I have no idea what pills will work and I want to do it that way because it just makes you tired but I just don’t know which ones will work I don’t want to be saved while my body is shutting down
suicide,"Considering this, it's the best option. Hope I do it before I turn 18 this year. If you're very young and having issues don't take your life. Puberty makes you feel a lot of stuff. It's hard for your parents to adjust to that stage. Give it time and live"
